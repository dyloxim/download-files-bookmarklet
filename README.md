# download-files-bookmarklet

To use the bookmarklet:
1. make a new bookmark of any page
2. edit that bookmark by copy-pasting the contents of the file `script.js` in place of the website location field.
3. move the bookmark to your bookmarks bar (with an appropriate name)

Once done, clicking the bookmark (in the bookmarks bar) will trigger the script to run.
